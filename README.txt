============

The goal of this project is to be a simple GUI for a small touch screen that wraps a printing command.
The program asks the user for a file and some additional instructions and then launches a printing command.

The program is written in Java 8 and requires the Java SE 1.8 standard library. One of the design goals is to require no additional libraries outside the standard library and the printing command of the OS.

The current target platform is a RasPi attached to a 5" 800x480 touch screen running Raspbian Linux, but ports to other systems should be pretty easy to do.
